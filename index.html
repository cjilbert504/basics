			Hey cool, I can embed heading tags inside link tags (I later learned that <br>
			saying "nest heading tags" would have probably been more proper). If you looked <br>
			at that post, I write things in Rails and also am always trying to get better <br>
			at the Ruby itself. Up to this point the learning I've done in Ruby/Rails has <br>
			been taking place for about thirteen months as of eleven.nineteen.two thousand twenty.

			I can't full articulate why I am doing this, though I speculate that it is because
			I feel as though as should feebly try to master the basics of putting things on the
			web. I don't know if that's the total story, maybe I sort of feel like it will help me
			finally not always cringe when it comes to a mildly complex form in a Rails app.

			Ok back on task, I just read about br tags. Give me a minute going put some of those <br>
			throughout what's been written previously. So what I am doing now is just going through <br>
			the w3 html docs/ I guess sort of tutorial, OH! in fact let me link you there!
