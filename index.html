					currently working through the pickaxe book aka programming ruby book, an eight hundred plus page behemoth, one chapter at a time. I really have a strong desire to try to obtain a certain level of proficency with the language. I have always be in awe of those who create, write and maintain some of the most amazing ruby gems and I hope to one day have one fifth of that level of knowledge.

					Pragmatic Studio - Rails five level two course is the other thing I am working on at the moment. Attempting to grow my knowledge with RSpec and TDD.

				This is the first sentence of the first paragraph on this page. What this
				really is, is my first real attempt at making a plain html webpage. How far
				does this go before it wraps to the next line? Seemingly pretty far; here is 
				the link to my first blog post:
				<a href="https://dev.to/collinjilbert/basic-enum-usage-for-defining-roles-or-statuses-on-models-in-rails-3c2f">

				Hey cool, I can embed heading tags inside link tags (I later learned that
				saying "nest heading tags" would have probably been more proper). If you looked
				at that post, I write things in Rails and also am always trying to get better
				at the Ruby itself. Up to this point the learning I've done in Ruby/Rails has
				been taking place for about thirteen months as of eleven.nineteen.two thousand twenty.
			</p>

			<p>
				I can't full articulate why I am doing this, though I speculate that it is because
				I feel as though as should feebly try to master the basics of putting things on the
				web. I don't know if that's the total story, maybe I sort of feel like it will help me
				finally not always cringe when it comes to a mildly complex form in a Rails app.

				Ok back on task, I just read about br tags. Give me a minute going put some of those
				throughout what's been written previously. So what I am doing now is just going through
				the w3 html docs/ I guess sort of tutorial, OH! in fact let me link you there!
